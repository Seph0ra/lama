_Lama, the application that does not mache these words._

## Description
Lama is a tool for mixing a word list.
The  goal is to obtain a custom password dictionary to a particular target, whether physical or moral.

It is therefore important that the words in this list correspond to the target.

Keep in mind that the Lama generates a simple password list and not complex, this goal is to be fast and targeted rather than slow and exostif.
